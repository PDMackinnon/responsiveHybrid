responsiveHybrid
================
Another demo using the DJCAD webview template to show a responsive - Foundation 5 - web site. In this I have added links to two menu items which are intercepted by the UIWebView delegate (set as the controller) and invoking a push seque to another view controller. For demo purposes, each has an image, but any new content - native or web - could go there. As it is a push, the lot is embedded in a Navigation controller, so a back button is automatically provided.
